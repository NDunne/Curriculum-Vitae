 \section{intro}
I am a student of Computer Science at The University of Warwick, moving into my final year in 2019 having taken an intercalated year to work as a Software Development Intern at Sophos. I consider myself a dedicated and hardworking student, with a positive attitude and a desire to improve that helps me to quickly develop new skills. Currently I am looking for a graduate position for 2020, and hope to find somewhere that will continue to challenge me after university, and allow me to use and expand on the knowledge and skills I have gained over the course of
my degree.

 \section{Employment}
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ X X }
Software Engineering Intern & June 2019 - August 2019 \\
ARM Ltd. & \\
  \end{tabularx}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Assigned to the ‘Clamshell’ team to work on optimisation of the chromium web browser.
   \item Took over an investigation from a graduate into Automatic Feedback Directed Optimisation, and how it could be applied to chromium for performance increase through providing branch information to the compiler.
   \item This required me to become familiar with building the Linux Kernel, to enable support for hardware tracing, and use an ARM hardware development board for the majority of my work. I also expanded my debugging knowledge with gdb/gdbserver, carrying over what I had learnt at Sophos and expanding on it.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ X X }
Software Engineering Intern & July 2018 - June 2019 \\
Sophos Plc. & \\
  \end{tabularx}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Assigned to the ‘Fasttrack’ team to work as Development for Global Escalations Support.
   \item Investigated customer and internal product issues when code analysis or a higher level of technical understanding was needed, requiring me to learn a number of Windows Debugging tools, as well as quickly become familiar with new code bases in .Net, C++ and C for different components.
   \item Root causes where identified through live or static debugging, and analysis of logs generated by the product itself as well as troubleshooting tools e.g. Sysinternals, WireShark. In cases where a genuine bug existed I was sometimes able to implement fixes for the team that owned the product.
  \end{itemize}
