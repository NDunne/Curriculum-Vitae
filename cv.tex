\section*{Nathan Dunne}
I am a student of Computer Science at The University of Warwick, moving into my final year in 2019 having taken an intercalated year to work as a Software Development Intern at Sophos. I consider myself a dedicated and hardworking student, with a positive attitude and a desire to improve that helps me to quickly develop new skills. Currently I am looking for a graduate position for 2020, and hope to find somewhere that will continue to challenge me after university, and allow me to use and expand on the knowledge and skills I have gained over the course of my degree.

 \section*{Employment}
\textbf{Summer Intern Embedded Software Engineer} \hfill June 2019 - August 2019 \\
\textcolor{darkgray}{ARM Ltd.}
  \begin{itemize}
   \dash Assigned to the ‘Clamshell’ team to work on optimisation of the Chromium web browser.
   \dash Took over an investigation from a graduate into Automatic Feedback Directed Optimisation, and how it could be applied to chromium for performance increase through providing branch information to the compiler.
   \dash This required me to become familiar with building the Linux Kernel, to enable support for hardware tracing, and use an ARM hardware development board for the majority of my work. I also expanded my debugging knowledge with gdb/gdbserver, carrying over what I had learnt at Sophos and expanding on it.
  \end{itemize}
\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Placement Year Software Engineer} \hfill July 2018 - June 2019 \\
\textcolor{darkgray}{Sophos Plc.}
  \begin{itemize}
   \dash Assigned to the ‘Fasttrack’ team to work as Development for Global Escalations Support.
   \dash Investigated customer and internal product issues when code analysis or a higher level of technical understanding was needed, requiring me to learn a number of Windows Debugging tools, as well as quickly become familiar with new code bases in .Net, C++ and C for different components.
   \dash Root causes where identified through live or static debugging, and analysis of logs generated by the product itself as well as troubleshooting tools e.g. Sysinternals, WireShark. In cases where a genuine bug existed I was sometimes able to implement fixes for the team that owned the product.
  \end{itemize}

  \section*{Volunteering}
\textbf{Project Leader} \hfill October 2016 - June 2018 \\
\textcolor{darkgray}{Warwick Technology Volunteers}
   \begin{itemize}
    \dash Planned, coordinated and lead sessions for school age students aimed at inspiring them to utilise technology creatively rather than simply consuming it. Our sessions involved either Scratch or Arduino as a platform, and usually consisted of assisting the students through a set of resources we’ve created.
	\dash Also advertised the project to fellow uni students to gain more volunteers and run more sessions, and provided training for the volunteers, to ensure a sufficient level of technical knowledge for them to lead school sessions themselves.
	\dash This greatly improved my confidence, communication, presentation giving, and teamwork \& leadership skills.
